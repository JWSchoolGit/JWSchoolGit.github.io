    				<th>What role does physical activity play in your life?</th>
    				<th>Do you get enough movement each week?</th>

  				<tr>
    				<td>Physical activity is a way to improve yourself and get stronger. I think that everyone should do at least a little bit of physical activity every day to stay fit. Whenever you feel like you are a bit out of shape or are just bored, you can always just do some pushups, situps, or go for a jog.</td>
    				<td>I think I get a decent amount of movement every week, however on the weekends I don't really do much, so probably not much movement. But next spring or summer, I think I will try to be more active and go outside more, probably jogging some laps around the track near my house.</td>
    				<td>Activity can affect your mood, energy and stress by forcing your body to use its resources and energy to do your task. When you exercise and feel the burn, you can tell that you are getting stronger.</td>
